## Test Your Game! (Part 5 of 5)
Click the **Test Game** button in the top toolbar to give your game a try.

You should be able to walk with the left and right arrow keys and jump with “z”. 

Try pushing the Clown Actors around and jumping on them. If you fall off the screen, the Scene should reload.

> **Note:** You can quickly test your game at any time using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Enter (or Command-Enter on Mac).

## Congratulations!
You've just created and tested your first game in Stencyl. That's quite an accomplishment already, and we've barely even scratched the surface of Stencyl's capabilities.

## Where do I go from here?
There's a whole lot more to Stencyl, and we encourage you to experiment on your own and read through the rest of Stencylpedia to find out how to import your own resources, create your own Behaviors, and enable Stencyl to help you create the games of your dreams.

If you'd like a more in-depth guided tour, we recommend jumping straight into Crash Course 2, where you can create your own Space Invaders-like game.

## Troubleshooting

#### When I fall into the pit, the scene doesn't reload.
As directed in Part 3 at the end of the Customizing Noni section, attach the Die in Pit and Reload behavior to Noni.

#### Noni and Clown don't collide.
Don't forget to set Clown's Actor Group to Enemies.
 
#### I receive a Flash error when running the game. The screen is just white.
[Please post a topic on the forums](http://community.stencyl.com/index.php/board,3.0.html) and attach the game to your post. (Use File > Export Game... to do this)
