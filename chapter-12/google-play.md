## Leaderboards and Achievements

Both Leaderboards and Achievements encourage light-hearted competition between players. Leaderboards are a place for all players to post their high scores while achievements increase your players' engagement by encouraging them to explore parts of the game or take on certain styles of play they may not have otherwise used.

## Events, Quests and Rewards

Events are like **analytics**. They let you collect data from your players during a game, so that you can use this data as feedback to let you improve your game. For example, you can adjust the difficulty level of certain levels in your game that players are finding too hard to complete.

**Quests** build on top of events by letting you form time-restricted challenges based on event data. Quests are useful to letting you lure players back in your game, if used in conjunction with **Rewards**, an in-game benefit that is awarded upon completing a Quest.

#### Setup

Events, Quests and Rewards must be set up on the [Google Play Developer Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/). Consult Google's guide on [https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/quests](Events and Quests) to set these up.
