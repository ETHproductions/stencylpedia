[Custom Events](http://www.stencyl.com/help/view/custom-events/) let you define an event that is called from this behavior (using the `trigger event` block), or as a response to messages that get sent by other behaviors (using one of the `trigger event ... in ...` blocks). The former is like a function call. The latter is different from function calls since sending out a message doesn't specify a recipient, so multiple recipients could exist.

![event-custom-code](http://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/block-images/13%20-%20Events/19%20-%20Advanced/event-custom-code.png)

Not an event. Lets you insert arbitrary code into your behavior at the "class" level. You could use this to define functions or add class-level fields, for example. Use code blocks within this wrapper.

![event-custom-import](http://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/block-images/13%20-%20Events/19%20-%20Advanced/event-custom-import.png)

Not an event. Lets you add **import statements** to the beginning of your behavior's "class". Use code blocks within this wrapper.
