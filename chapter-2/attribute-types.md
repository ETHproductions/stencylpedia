Earlier in this chapter, [you learned about Attributes](http://www.stencyl.com/help/view/attributes/), which are changeable and configurable properties of Behaviors. What kinds of Attributes are at your disposal?

## Gotchas

Something you might bump into fairly early on is this.

![Cannot configure](http://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch4/customize/image05.png)

Why are some Attributes unconfigurable?

* There's nothing to configure. (Effects)
* It's an Actor behavior, so until the actor's actually inside a scene, there's no context for being able to pick out a specific (Actor or Region)

For the latter case, this can be addressed by [customizing the Actor](http://www.stencyl.com/help/viewArticle/117/) once it's inside a scene.
