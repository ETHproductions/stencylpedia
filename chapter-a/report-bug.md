## How do I report a bug?

All bugs should be reported on one of these two methods.

* [Forums](http://community.stencyl.com/index.php/board,119.0.html)
  <br/>Use this if you are new to Stencyl and do not understand why the bug is happening. (e.g. your game won't run)

* [Issue Tracker](http://community.stencyl.com/index.php?project=1)
  <br/>For experienced (or technically-minded) users, or if you hit a bug in the toolset itself.

> Please do not send us bug reports via e-mail or via other sources. 

 
## What should a bug report include?

Include the following to maximize the chance of the bug being resolved in a timely fashion.

1. A concise but precise description of the bug. At a minimum, tell us what you expected to happen, what actually happened and how you got it to happen.

2. [Logs](http://www.stencyl.com/help/viewArticle/135/)

3. Screenshots (if applicable)

4. A **sample game** exhibiting the bug along with exact instructions that explain how to duplicate the issue. Please spare us the effort and make this for us! Help us out and we'll help you.
