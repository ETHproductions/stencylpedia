Ever wanted to make your own RPG using Stencyl but found it to be too difficult, too complex, or simply a lot of work?  We here at Siren Games have developed the ultimate tool for anyone who wants to create their own RPGs using Stencyl.

You can add complicated items, armors, weapons, characters, dialog and more using the database, which is then added into the kit (the template project file) simply by naming them and setting their customizable values using the database.
