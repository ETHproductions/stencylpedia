## What are Repositories?

Repositories are collections of related extensions (both toolset and engine) that are hosted together on a site and can be selectively installed. In this way, you can pick and choose which extensions you wish to install.

> *If you've used an IDE such as Eclipse, repositories are like sites for plugins.*


## The Repositories

Name | Repository URL | Author | Description

## How to Add a Repository

1. Open Stencyl.
2. From the main menu, go to **Extensions > Get Extensions**.
3. Click the **Click to Add Repository** button.
4. Enter in the **Repository URL** above.
5. Wait for the extensions to show up. This takes time. Install the ones you want.
6. Now open up your games like normal and enable the extensions.
